# Hexon-θ v0.2 — Full Rules Specification

**Date**: December 13, 2025  
**Version**: 0.2 (includes mandatory anti-misuse clauses)

Hexon-θ is a precision language designed to make the strength of evidence and ethical impact of any claim **structurally visible** and **dishonesty expensive**.

## Core Evidence Tiers (mandatory on every claim)
[1] Peer-reviewed primary source  
[2] Official agency / telescope data  
[3] Expert consensus only  
[4] Preprint / reputable author  
[5] Personal logic / observation (maximum allowed for opinions or subjective views)  
[6∅] No evidence → automatically quarantined (cannot be used as a premise for further claims)

## Operators
↔ Bidirectional ethical accounting (evaluate impact on all affected parties)  
↑ Net increase in lives / well-being (measured in θ-units: well-being of one conscious being for one year)  
↓ Net decrease in lives / well-being  
P[low–high]% Probability range for projections or predictions

## Mandatory Anti-Misuse Rules (v0.2)

1. **Source Link Mandatory**  
   Any claim tagged [1] or [2] **must** include a verifiable link/DOI/archival URL.  
   Failure to provide → automatic downgrade to [5] or [6∅].

2. **Quarantine Challenge Rule**  
   Any [6∅] tag may be publicly challenged with evidence.  
   - Successful challenge → original tagger downgraded.  
   - Failed challenge → challenger downgraded.  
   Public reputation ledger encouraged.

3. **Self-Tag Disclosure**  
   Personal opinions or beliefs **must not exceed [5]**.  
   Claiming [1]–[4] for subjective views = automatic dishonesty flag → entire statement quarantined.

4. **Ethical Vector Symmetry**  
   No claim may assert ↔ ↑ net lives without explicitly addressing any known ↓ side (and vice versa).  
   Omission → downgrade to [5] or [6∅].

5. **Version Stamp Required**  
   Every complete Hexon-θ statement **must** end with exactly:  
   `#HexonTheta-v0.2`  
   Use of outdated or forked versions = automatic [6∅] quarantine.

## Example Statements
- Human activity drives recent warming [1] https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/acd520 ↔ ↑ net lives long-term ∧ ↓ short-term disruption → net ↑ P[95-99]% #HexonTheta-v0.2
- Mandatory policies increase compliance [3] ↔ ↑ lives for some ∧ ↓ trust via coercion → net debated #HexonTheta-v0.2
- My opinion on this topic [5] ↔ neutral evidence #HexonTheta-v0.2

These rules are **non-negotiable** in v0.2. Misuse triggers visible quarantine.

Open source. Evolve or kill.
