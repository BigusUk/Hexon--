# Hexon-θ v0.2

A precision language designed to make truth structurally visible and dishonesty expensive.

## Core Goal
Force evidence tagging, ethical symmetry, and anti-misuse rules so reliability is scannable at a glance.

## Rules & Anti-Misuse
See [RULES.md](RULES.md) for full v0.2 specification.

## Vision
Auto-verifier bot, auto-assigner tool, reputation ledger — coming soon.

Open source. Collaboration, criticism, and feedback welcome.
