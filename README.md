# Hexon-θ v0.2

A precision language designed to make truth structurally visible and dishonesty expensive.

## Core Goal
Force evidence tagging, ethical symmetry, and anti-misuse rules so reliability is scannable at a glance.

## Activation Prompts
- [Pure Mode]— AI responds only in Hexon-θ
- [Workflow Mode] — Normal English + Hexon verification (recommended)

## Rules & Anti-Misuse
See Misuse Rules for full v0.2 specification.

## Vision
Auto-verifier bot, auto-assigner tool, reputation ledger — coming soon.

## Stress Test & Criticism

Transparency over ego. If the criticisms hold, we end it.

Open source. Collaboration, criticism, and feedback welcome.
