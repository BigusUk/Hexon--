# Hexon-θ v0.3 — Precision Language Update

This version refines Hexon-θ for general, collaborative use across platforms, with a focused change to tier 6.

## Key Change: Tier 6 Protocol
- v0.2: [6∅] No evidence → automatically quarantined (restricted from use as premise, isolated to prevent misinformation spread).
- v0.3: [6∅] No evidence → automatically flagged with warning (highlighted as unsubstantiated; may not be relied on as a premise without upgrade, but remains visible and discussable).

**Why the Change in v0.3?**  
To emphasize transparency and discussion in general settings. Warnings make weakness visible without silencing claims, allowing critique and challenge, whilst eliminating the need for censorship. This makes v0.3 better for open environments (e.g., AI chats, forums) where visibility fosters truth-seeking and freedom of speech, over strict isolation.

## Why Keep Quarantine in Other Versions?
- Pure Mode (v0.2): Quarantine retained for maximum precision in "full Hexon only" responses — suits high-stakes, 'no-fluff' scenarios where unsubstantiated claims should be fully blocked to avoid any reliance.
- High Level Substantiated Flow (v0.2): Quarantine kept for personal fact-checking and STEM/educational outputs — stricter handling ensures only [1]–[3] evidence is used, preventing misinformation in sensitive tools and repositories.

v0.3 Workflow Mode is for everyday use — normal English + verification block.
